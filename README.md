## Title: Avocado Fruit Analysis and Price Prediction

### A. Description:
This project focuses on analyzing avocado data to gain insights into avocado prices, production regions, yearly trends, and more. It involves data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning to answer the following key questions:

### B. Dataset Description: 
The dataset contains various attributes such as Date, AveragePrice, Total Volume, Total Bags, 4046, 4225, 4770, type, etc.

We will be using the following dataset:

      avocado.csv

### C. Questions Addressed:
      1. Which region has the lowest and highest prices of Avocado?
      2. What is the highest region of avocado production?
      3. What are the average avocado prices in each year?
      4. What are the average avocado volumes in each year?


## -Tasks Performed:

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
* Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, if any.
* Explored the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and distribution of features.
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 2. Data Visualization:
* Utilized various data visualization techniques to gain insights, including:\
      1. **Histograms:** To visualize price distributions.\
      2. **Scatter Plots:** To explore relationships between variables.\
      3. **Boxen Plots:** For detailed price distribution analysis.\
      4. **Count Plots:** To count occurrences in categorical data.

### 3. Model Building:
Implemented several regression models for price prediction, including:
* **Linear Regression**\
* **Decision Tree Regression**\
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**\
* **Random Forest Regression**\
* **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**

### 4. Visualization of Key Insights:
Created visualizations to provide clear answers to the project's key questions:
* A geographical map showing the regions with the lowest and highest avocado prices.
* A production heatmap highlighting the region with the highest production.
* Line charts illustrating the average avocado prices and volumes by year.

### 5. Model Evaluation:
* Evaluated every model's performance on the testing dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, MAE, MSE, R2-Score.
